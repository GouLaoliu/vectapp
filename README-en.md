# VectApp

When snowflake appeared, we were very excited to see the dawn of cloud data services and the data changes brought about. We conducted research around snowflake, databricks, airtable and other products, and decided to use a page similar to snowflake to develop front-end products in the first edition. Unfortunately, with the departure of our technical partner, our entrepreneurial dream came to an end, so we decided to open source the code, hoping to help our friends with the same dream.




## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
